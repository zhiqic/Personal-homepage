        <h3>Biography</h3>

        Zhi-Qi Cheng is a Project Scientist at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), which is part of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He earned his B.S. in Computer Science from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2014 and completed his Ph.D. in 2019. During his doctoral studies, he was a visiting Ph.D. student at the City University of Hong Kong (2016-2017) and later at CMU (2017-2019). He also gained valuable experience through internships at Alibaba DAMO Academy (2016), Google Brain (2018), and Microsoft Research (2019).

        From 2019 to 2022, he served as a postdoctoral research associate at CMU. During his time at CMU, he made significant contributions to several key projects, including DARPA's AIDA, KAIROS, IARPA's DIVA, and NIST's PSIAP. Notably, on the DARPA KAIROS project, he was solely responsible for building the system for the entire CMU team. His research has had a substantial impact, such as being utilized in the Washington Post's coverage of the Capitol riots, for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Additionally, he has been honored with the Intel Ph.D. Fellowship and IBM Outstanding Student Scholarship.
